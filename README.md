# bro_down_throw_down

**This is not a serious app.**

The idea for this app was mentioned during a Dev Bootcamp pitch day.
I'm working on this because I like silly ideas and there is also a lot of potential features to add. It seems like a fun challenge.

## The idea
"It's like Tindr, but for fighting." You can use this app to find people to fight.

## Stuff I'm learning on this project
I'm doing this as a learning exercise - so here's what I'm learning.....

- pg_search
- creating twitter style follow-follower associations
- bootstrap/sass
- action mailer


## MVP User stories.....as a user I want to
- create an account
- log in
- edit my account
- search for people to fight by fighting style
- 'star' accounts of people who I'd like to fight in the future
- see a list of users I have starred
- see a list of users who have starred me
- send a message to a user asking to fight

## Future features
- enter stats of a fight and have the other fighter verify them
- see the stats of all the fights I've had
- search for users based on other physical crteria - height, weight, ect
- search for users who are geographically nearby
- create fight events and have another user accept them
- have a one-page interface
- Use the app on my phone

## Tech Stack
- PostgreSQL
- Rails
- pg_search for searching
- Not sure about the JavaScript yet - thinking about a Backbone/Knockout combo or giving Knockback.js a try
- Bootstrap for the CSS and layout
- SASS
